<p style="text-align:justify"> I am a Quantitative Researcher in Cambridge, MA. I work at QLS Advisors, an investment manager that is dedicated to improving outcomes for both healthcare investors and patients. The company was founded in 2019 by MIT Professor Andrew W. Lo and Shomesh E. Chaudhuri. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> Previously, I was a software engineer at Siemens Digital industries software working on computational geometry for the Parasolid geometric kernel used in many CAD/CAE/CAM packages.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> I obtained a BSc in Mathematics at Imperial College London and an MSc in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Oxford. In England, my research interests were mostly in differential geometry, computational algebra and graph theory.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> I graduated from Harvard University with an ME in Computational Science and Engineering in 2022. In Cambridge, I was fortunate to be taught by great professors and mentors including Chris Rycroft and Weiwei Pan and to be advised by Pavlos Protopapas and Marios Mattheakis for my thesis.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> Currently, my research is in machine learning (PINNs, geometric deep learning).</p>

My Erd≈ës number is 4.
